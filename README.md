<h3><b>Florida GreenGuard AI</b></h3>
An app and environmental tool developed to equip environmentalists and residents in the Sunshine State with the power to recognize possible threats towards ecosystem health and biodiversity. With the rapid spread of invasive species, Florida’s unique, expansive, and cherished ecosystems stand to lose their natural rich biodiversity to overpopulation and invasive competition for resources. Florida GreenGuard AI aims to empower the people of Florida to recognize potential threats to the state’s natural tropical beauty.
</br>
The app leverages the power of a machine learning image classification model trained on hundreds of non-native plant species (to the state of Florida) from tens of thousands of collected images of non-Florida native flora. With this tool, the hope is for environmentalists and interested residents alike to identify non-native plant species in Florida with high accuracy and take the required steps to deal with wildlife that impact the state’s biodiversity.
